# my-trello-rails

This is the rails-powered version of `my-trello`, a Trello clone originally created for the front-end Launch School course. This app is being created as the capstone project for Launch School's course 301.

This app features a Backbone.js front end, which talks to a JSON API. It is an exercise in using Rails to back a mostly-single-page web application, as well as structuring data for that purpose.

## Todo

- Add user/membership features, like board admin and list membership.
- AJAXify memberships.
- Enable dragging and dropping of lists and cards (in other words, make it actually like Trello).
- Integrate Todoist!
